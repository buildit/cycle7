# Cycle 7 site WIP

A single page exploration of what Cycle 7 is and why you should consider it when pushing forwards a new digital proposition.

1. Clone the repo, navigate to `cycle7-site` directory
2. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
3. Run the Gatsby development server `gatsby develop`
4. Site should then be running at `http://localhost:8000/`
